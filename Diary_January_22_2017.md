##### Meeting with Ateev

	1. Reviewed Responsive Grid. I need to re-build the grid and keep design the CSS (column classes) so the grid remains responsive however the HTML is programmed. (See Bootstrap example - http://getbootstrap.com/css/)
	2. Discussed interview milestone (Taco Queen - Unit 1 and 2 review)
	3. Looked over Unit 3 - Lesson 1
		* DOM traversal
		* Event listeners (currentTarget, stopPropagation() etc...)

##### To Do

	* Review for Interview (Unit 1 and 2)
	* Schedule interview after review of material
	* Unit 3 Lesson 1 - jQuery (For Tuesday meeting)
	* Capstone project - rough draft idea
